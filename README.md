Sudoku game in Zig using SDL2
==============

A fun test of [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig) and [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) concepts.

Requires SDL2 and SDL\_image to be installed / locatable

Simple sdl wrapper in deps/ as I originally was symlinking / submoduling the sdl wrapper but for now it's just copied in as-is for playing with a "zig package"
